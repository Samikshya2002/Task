Project Overview

This project implements a scrolling card interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can navigate through cards by dragging up or down on desktop or swiping on touch-enabled devices. The cards transition smoothly and cycle in a loop.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Steps
Clone or download the project files to your local system.
Ensure the directory contains the following files:
index.html: Main HTML structure.
styles.css: CSS styles for the project.
scripts.js: JavaScript functionality.
Open index.html in your preferred web browser to view and interact with the card scrolling interface.

Technology Choices and Rationale
HTML
Provides the structure for the card interface.
Semantic tags like <div> and <script> improve maintainability.

CSS
Enables a responsive and visually appealing design using flexbox and custom animations.
Gradient backgrounds and box shadows enhance the user interface.

JavaScript
Implements card scrolling functionality.
Handles mouse and touch events for cross-device compatibility.

Known Limitations / Trade-offs

Performance on Large Numbers of Cards:
The current implementation may lag if the number of cards significantly increases due to DOM updates.

Accessibility:
Navigation relies on dragging and swiping; keyboard accessibility is not implemented.

Cross-Browser Compatibility:
May require additional testing and adjustments for older browsers.

Scaling:
The card dimensions are fixed. Additional work may be needed for dynamic resizing.

Future Improvements

Accessibility Enhancements:
Add keyboard navigation and ARIA roles to improve usability for users with assistive technologies.

Dynamic Card Loading:
Implement lazy loading for better performance with large datasets.

Customization Options:
Allow users to change the card size, color, and animation speed dynamically.

Responsive Design:
Improve responsiveness to handle various screen sizes, including tablets and smaller devices.

Testing:
Perform automated testing to ensure smooth functionality across devices and browsers.
